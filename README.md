# Data_Structures

Project 1 - implementing array of Structures, Linear Search, and Bubble Sorting Algorithm

Project 2 - implementing Object Oriented programming  

Project 3 - implementing the Standard Template Libary (STL) and Adjacency Lists to develop the list of flights from Origin to Destination (showing the Flight number and Price).

Project 4 - continuation of Project 3 to develop a flight itinerary for the user by using classes, STL vectors and lists. The program first reads in from a file to make the vector of citites and then reads from another file to read into and create the adjacency list (using the STL list to create the Flight map) that displays the avaliable flights to and from the Origin and Destination. 

Project 5 - implementing recursion and backtracking to solve a classic maze problem.

Project 6 - implementing Binary Serach Trees, Standard Template Library lists, Recursion, and Object Oriented Programming (Usage of Mutiple Classes) to create a program that creates a concordance for a given text file.
