# Data_Structures

This repository contains In-class projects that demonstrate my understanding of Advanced topics in the branch of Data Structures and Algorithms

Project 1 - demostrates my understanding of advanced topics such as Array of Structures, Linear Search, and Bubble Sorting Algorithm

Project 2 - demostrates my understanding of advanced topics such as Object Oriented programming (Multiple usage of Classes) to better solve the roster class problem

Project 3 - demostrates my understanding of advanced topics of using Standard Template Libary and implementation of an Adjacency List to develop the list of flights from Origin to Destination (showing the Flight number and Price).

Project 4 - (Uses code from Project 3 ) to develop a flight itinerary for the user by using classes, STL vectors and lists. The program first reads in from a file to make the vector of citites and then reads from another file to read into and create the adjacency list (using the STL list to create the Flight map) that displays the avaliable flights to and from the Origin and Destination. The information is the origins, destinations, flight numbers and the price of the total flight.

Project 5 - demostrates my understanding of Recursion and backtracking to solve the classic maze problem.

Project 6 - demostrates my understanding of Binary Serach Trees, Standard Template Library lists, Recursion, and Object Oriented Programming (Usage of Mutiple Classes) to create a program that creates a concordance for a given text file.
